## Not so short description
### farming
The farming mod is central part of this modpack, providing a new system for registering plants, mainly for eating and drinking.
Several different kind of crops are registered by one function. Each property is defined by the data provided.

The given crops are defined in one spreadsheet, one row for each crop.

The crops can be harvested or punched to give drop items. The drop items can be directly planted or they have to be processed to give plantable items.

Plants can get ill, infecting nearby plants and degenerate till grass. The full grown crops can wilt, loosing the harvest and after some time get to grass.

Many other mods depends on a farming mod, making it difficult to enhance farming with other nice things, like awards. For this, the farming mod is enhanced with other mods, combined in a modpack.

### farming awards
Some farming based awards like miller for crafting enough flour.

### farming crafts
Outsourced craft items not needed inside farming mod, like cutting board. Make the farming mod more slim.

### farming integrate
Several crops should also grow on ground, defined by other mods. Sadly this mods depends on farming mod, which makes it difficult to spread the crops on new defined ground nodes.

## farming xpfw
Statistic about farming, counting punched fruits and harvested crops. With this counters an experience system is provided, getting more drop items with higher experience.
